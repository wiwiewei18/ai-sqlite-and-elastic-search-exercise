# Introduction to Querying: SQLite and Elasticsearch

This repository serves as an introductory guide to querying data using **SQLite** and **Elasticsearch** with Python. It demonstrates basic query operations and highlights the differences between a relational database and a search engine.

## Overview

The main objective of this project is to provide hands-on examples of querying data using two different technologies:

1. **SQLite**: A lightweight relational database for structured data.
2. **Elasticsearch**: A distributed search engine for full-text search and analytics.

By comparing the query approaches, the project illustrates their strengths and ideal use cases.

## Technologies

- **Python** (3.8 or later)
- **SQLite** (`sqlite` module)
- **Elasticsearch** (Python client: `elasticsearch`)

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system
- Elasticsearch installed and running locally or on a remote server
